The paper I chose to extend to satisfy the project requirements is titled *"Voronoi-based Coverage Control with Connectivity Maintenance for
Robotic Sensor Networks"*. I have included this research paper in the `/doc` folder of this repository, and it can be viewed at the link below.

The main code for this repository is located ___. The scripts `voronoi.py` and `_` are the baselines, referring to the Standard Voronoi partitioning and the proposed partitioning from the research paper, respectively. My algorithm is `_`, and builds on the proposed algorithm by implementing a dynamic communication range.
